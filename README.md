# Wtf-doc - small command line utility to add documentation to the folders

Never run into so many folders that you have no idea what contains what? This is a tool to add a descriptions to your folders. 
Especially useful in Linux servers when collaborating with many other people. A .wtf file is created into the current folder and a small description can be added and readed from it just by running 'wtf' in the command line.

This small utility will create a .wtf file containing a txt description of the current folder


## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wtf-doc

## Usage

    $ wtf # to know that is going on into a folder
    $ wtf doc # to add a description to a folder
    $ wtf clean # to cleanup the .wtf file from a folder
